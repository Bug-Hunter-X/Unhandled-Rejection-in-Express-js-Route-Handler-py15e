# Unhandled Rejection in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled rejections in asynchronous route handlers.  When an asynchronous operation within a route handler throws an error, and that error is not properly caught, the Express.js server might crash without providing informative error messages.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that demonstrates best practices for handling errors in asynchronous Express.js routes.

## Problem

The problem lies in the lack of proper error handling within the `.catch()` block of the `someAsyncOperation()` promise.  The server logs the error but doesn't send a response to the client, nor does it gracefully handle the failure and continue operation.  This can lead to unexpected server crashes and poor user experience.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly handling potential errors within the `.catch()` block.  This includes sending an appropriate error response to the client (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error) and optionally implementing more robust error logging or monitoring.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` to see the buggy behavior.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to observe the improved, error-handled version.
